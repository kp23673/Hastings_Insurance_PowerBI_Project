# Background

The Commercial team are responsible for developing and delivering Hastingsâ€™ Street pricing strategy and driving commercial performance whilst ensuring fair customer outcomes.
Your Commercial Director would like you to identify some pricing opportunities in the data we have available. 
You are given a dummy sample dataset of quotes with sale information (please find column descriptions in the appendix below). 
An existing A/B price test can be analysed, where group A saw no price change and group B received a 1% discount.

# Dataset Overview:

The dataset contains 10,000 rows and 16 columns.
This dataset appears to be related to an insurance price test experiment. It contains records of customer quotes and sales, segmented into different pricing test groups (A & B).
The main purpose of this data is likely to analyze the effectiveness of different pricing strategies and their impact on conversion rates and profitability.
